# Neural Networks
A neural network, also known as an artificial neural network (ANN), is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the human brain. Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes or "neurons", which are designed to mimic the neurons in a biological brain. Each of these nodes takes in input, applies a function to that input, and then passes the output to nodes in the next layer.

## Intuition behind Neural Networks
In essence, a neural network takes in inputs, which are then processed in hidden layers using weights that are adjusted during training. The model then outputs a prediction as output. The weights are adjusted to find patterns in order to make better predictions. Neural networks learn from the input they process by adjusting the weights in order to predict the correct output. These weights are adjusted via techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent, which aim to minimize the difference between the actual and predicted output.

## Terminology
- **Input Layer**: The input layer is the first layer of the neural network. It takes in the input data and passes it to the hidden layers.
- **Hidden Layer**: The hidden layers are the layers between the input and output layers. They process the input data and pass it to the output layer.
- **Output Layer**: The output layer is the last layer of the neural network. It outputs the prediction of the model.
- **Neuron**: A neuron is a node in a neural network. It takes in input, applies a function to that input, and then passes the output to nodes in the next layer.
- **Activation Function**: An activation function is a function that is applied to the input of a neuron. It is used to introduce non-linearity into the model.
- **Weights**: Weights are values that are assigned to the connections between neurons. They are adjusted during training in order to find patterns in the data.
- **Bias**: Bias is a constant value that is added to the input of a neuron. It is used to adjust the output of the activation function.
- **Epoch**: An epoch is a single iteration of the training data through the neural network.
- **Batch**: A batch is a subset of the training data that is used to train the neural network. The weights are updated after each batch.
- **Optimizer**: An optimizer is an algorithm that is used to minimize the loss function. It is used to adjust the weights of the neural network.
- **Backpropagation**: Backpropagation is a technique that is used to adjust the weights of the neural network. It is used to minimize the loss function.
