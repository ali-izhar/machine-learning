# Machine Learning Theory and Practice
This repository contains various machine learning algorithms and their implementations in Python using the Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Tensorflow libraries. The algorithms are organized by category and are grouped into folders based on their category. Please note that this repository is a work in progress and is constantly being updated.

## Motivation

- **ANI vs AGI:** ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) is the concept of an AI system that can perform one task very well, such as self-driving cars or smart speakers. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is the concept of an AI system that can perform any task a human can. There has been a lot of progress in ANI, but AGI is still a long way off. The goal of this repository is to explore the various algorithms that are used to build ANI systems.

- **Neural Networks and Brain Simulation:** Although modern deep learning has seen advancements in simulating neurons, there are limitations. The artificial neurons we build are overly simplistic compared to their biological counterparts, and our understanding of how the human brain works is still rudimentary. The path to AGI through brain simulation appears to be quite challenging.

- **One Learning Algorithm Hypothesis:** Based on certain animal experiments, it is suggested that much of intelligence might be due to one or a few learning algorithms - the concept of `one learning algorithm hypothesis`. Depending on the input data, different parts of the brain can learn to perform various tasks. The challenge lies in discovering these algorithms and implementing them in a computer.

- **Flexibility of the Brain:** Experiments show that the human brain is highly adaptable, capable of processing a wide range of sensor inputs. Researchers are studying these mechanisms to understand if they can be replicated in AI systems.
