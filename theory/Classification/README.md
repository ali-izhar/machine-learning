# Classification Algorithms
Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the machine learning model learns from the data input given to it and then uses this learning to classify new observations.

## Concepts
Classification algorithms are used for predicting the category of given data. They are used in various real-world applications like spam detection, image recognition, and disease prediction, among others.

In binary classification problems, the model predicts one of two possible classes, while in multiclass classification, the model can predict more than two classes.

The key idea behind these algorithms is to model the probability that an observation belongs to each category. This probability is then used to classify the observation.
