# Learning Algorithm Performance: The Impact of Regularization Parameter

The choice of the regularization parameter (Lambda or $\lambda$) influences the bias and variance, ultimately affecting the overall performance of the learning algorithm.

## Regularization Parameter and Model Complexity
We begin with the exploration of the model's behavior under extreme regularization values.

- When $\lambda$ is set to a large value, the model's parameters are compelled to remain small to minimize the regularization term in the cost function. Consequently, this produces a simplistic model with high bias (underfitting) as it doesn't fit the training data well.

- On the other extreme, if $\lambda$ is set to a small value (even zero), the regularization effect is essentially nullified. The model tends to overfit the data, as seen in the form of a high-variance model.

An optimal value of $\lambda$ will ideally strike a balance between these extremes, resulting in a model that fits the data well with relatively low training and cross-validation errors.

## Selecting Regularization Parameter Using Cross-validation
To identify a suitable value for $\lambda$, we can utilize cross-validation. This process involves iteratively fitting the model with different $\lambda$ values and computing the corresponding cross-validation error. The $\lambda$ value that yields the lowest cross-validation error is then chosen as the optimal parameter.

## Understanding Error as a Function of Lambda
- For smaller $\lambda$ values, the model has high variance (overfitting), which results in a low training error but a high cross-validation error.

- For larger $\lambda$ values, the model suffers from high bias (underfitting), leading to high training and cross-validation errors.
