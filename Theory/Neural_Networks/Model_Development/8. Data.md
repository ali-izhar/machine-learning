# Machine Learning Data Engineering Techniques
This resource hosts a comprehensive guide that details various strategies for managing and enhancing data for machine learning applications.

## 1. Adding More Data
Machine learning applications often require large amounts of data. However, obtaining more data for every type can be time-consuming and expensive. **Instead, focus on adding data where analysis indicates it might help the most.** For instance, if error analysis reveals that your model struggles with identifying a particular type of spam email, target your efforts on gathering more examples of that type of spam. This approach can make your algorithm more proficient in identifying that particular type of spam.

## 2. Data Augmentation
This technique involves creating new training examples by slightly modifying existing ones. It's especially useful for image and audio data. For instance, an image of a letter can be rotated, enlarged, shrunk, or have its contrast altered to create a new training example. These changes teach the algorithm that these modifications don't change the fact that it's still the same letter.

## 3. Advanced Data Augmentation
This method takes data augmentation to the next level. For example, you can superimpose a grid on a letter and introduce random distortions to create a vast array of new training examples. This approach helps the learning algorithm learn more robustly.

## 4. Data Augmentation for Audio Data
One method of augmenting audio data is by adding background noise to an original audio clip, thereby creating an artificial scenario where someone is speaking in a noisy environment. This strategy can significantly increase your training dataset size.

## 5. Data Synthesis
This technique involves creating new examples from scratch, rather than modifying existing examples. A great example of data synthesis is in photo optical character recognition (OCR) tasks. You can generate synthetic data that looks very similar to real-world images by typing random text in different fonts, colors, and contrasts and then capturing screenshots.

## 6. Data-centric Approach
Instead of focusing on improving the code or the algorithm, it might be more productive to focus on engineering the data used by your algorithm. Techniques such as targeted data collection, data augmentation, and data synthesis can help improve your learning algorithm's performance.

## 7. Transfer Learning
This technique is useful when you don't have much data and it's difficult to obtain more. Transfer learning involves using data from a different, albeit somewhat related, task to improve your algorithm's performance on your application. This strategy is not applicable to every situation, but it can be highly effective when it does apply.
