    "\n",
    "Self-attention, also known as **scaled dot-product attention,** is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. Self-attention enables models to weigh the importance of different parts of an input sequence when making predictions or capturing dependencies between words.\n",

Crucially, the weights here are not the same as the (learned) parameters in a neural network layer. Instead, they are derived from the inputs. For example, one option is that we choose the weights to be dot-products:\n",

    "\n",
    "In practical applications, self-attention is often extended to multi-head attention. Instead of relying on a single set of learned transformations $(W_Q, W_K, W_V)$, multi-head attention uses multiple sets of transformations, or \"heads.\" Each head focuses on different aspects or relationships within the input sequence. The outputs of these heads are concatenated and linearly combined to produce the final self-attention output. This mechanism allows models to capture various types of information simultaneously."

To address this limitation, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings in transformers. These encodings provide the model with information about the positions of words in the sequence, enabling it to distinguish between words with the same content but different positions."
