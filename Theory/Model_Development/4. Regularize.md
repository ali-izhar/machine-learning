# Learning Algorithm Performance: The Impact of Regularization Parameter

The choice of the regularization parameter (Lambda or $\lambda$) influences the bias and variance, ultimately affecting the overall performance of the learning algorithm.

## Regularization Parameter and Model Complexity
We begin with the exploration of the model's behavior under extreme regularization values.

- When $\lambda$ is set to a large value, the model's parameters are compelled to remain small to minimize the regularization term in the cost function. Consequently, this produces a simplistic model with high bias (underfitting) as it doesn't fit the training data well.

- On the other extreme, if $\lambda$ is set to a small value (even zero), the regularization effect is essentially nullified. The model tends to overfit the data, as seen in the form of a high-variance model.

An optimal value of $\lambda$ will ideally strike a balance between these extremes, resulting in a model that fits the data well with relatively low training and cross-validation errors.

## Selecting Regularization Parameter Using Cross-validation
To identify a suitable value for $\lambda$, we can utilize cross-validation. This process involves iteratively fitting the model with different $\lambda$ values and computing the corresponding cross-validation error. The $\lambda$ value that yields the lowest cross-validation error is then chosen as the optimal parameter.

## Understanding Error as a Function of Lambda
- For smaller $\lambda$ values, the model has high variance (overfitting), which results in a low training error but a high cross-validation error.

- For larger $\lambda$ values, the model suffers from high bias (underfitting), leading to high training and cross-validation errors.

## Frobenius Norm
In a neural network, the regularization term is computed as the sum of the squares of all the weights in the network. This is known as the Frobenius norm of the weight matrices and is denoted by $||w||^2$. The matrix $W$ has dimensions $n^{[l]} \times n^{[l-1]}$, where $n^{[l]}$ is the number of units in layer $l$ and $n^{[l-1]}$ is the number of units in layer $l-1$. The Frobenius norm is computed as follows:

$$||w^{(l)}||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n^{[l]}} \sum_{j=1}^{n^{[l-1]}} (w_{ij}^{[l]})^2$$

Therefore, the cost function with regularization is given by:

$$J(W,b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} L(\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{l=1}^{L} ||w^{[l]}||^2$$
