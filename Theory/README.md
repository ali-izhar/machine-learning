# Understanding the Basic Concept of Matrix Multiplication in ML
Matrix multiplication, often represented as $Y = W \times X + b$, is fundamental to the workings of neural networks and a wide variety of machine learning algorithms. In this article, we'll delve into matrix multiplication, emphasizing its role in machine learning.

## Delving into $W \times X + b$
In the realm of machine learning, we frequently deal with an input dataset $X$ and a corresponding output $Y$. The primary objective of a machine learning algorithm is to discern a function $f$ that can effectively map inputs $X$ to their outputs $Y$. This is mathematically captured as $f(X)=Y$. To ascertain $f$, we need to determine the optimal parameters (or weights) $W$ and bias $b$ such that the equation $f(X)=W \times X + b$ holds true. Here:

- $W$ is a matrix, representing the weights.
- $b$ is a vector, symbolizing the bias.

The dimensions of $W$ are influenced by the number of rows in $X$ (features) and the number of columns in $Y$ (output dimensions). Meanwhile, $b$'s size is set by the number of rows in $Y$.

## Generalized Representation
Given an input data $X$ and output data $Y$, we can represent these matrices in their generalized form:
