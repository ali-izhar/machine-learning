    "# **About Python**\n",
    "Python is a programming language that is very popular among the machine learning research community.\n",
    "It is a higher-level programming language than Java, and has an extensive collection of libraries that can be easily installed.\n",
    "We require that you use python for this class, so it is important to be familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python vs Java\n",
    "- Java is compiled, but Python is not: you directly run the Python file\n",
    "- Java is statically typed (the types of the variables cannot change), and you do not declare types in Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This works in python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "x = \"python\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Instantiating a class in Python does not use `new`\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Assume there is a class called `Person`\n",
    "p = Person('Emily', 25)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Python does not use parentheses, like Java. Instead, it uses whitespace to infer the scope of methods, for loops, etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "      print(i * 2)      # Indent by 4 spaces\n",
    "      print(i * 4)\n",
    "print('Done')       # No indent, runs after for loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Functions cannot be overloaded, instead use optional arguments\n",
    "```\n",
    "def f(x, y=0.0):\n",
    "      ....\n",
    "f(8)\n",
    "f(8, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Boolean values are now `True` and `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python vs Matlab\n",
    "- Python uses hard brackets `[]` for indexing arrays and matrices instead of `()` in Matlab\n",
    "- Python is 0-indexed, so the first item in a list is at index 0, not 1\n",
    "- Python doesn't come by default with a full development tool, like Matlab\n",
    "- The `numpy` library in Python implements many of the same matrix functionality that Matlab has\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Environments\n",
    "- In this class we will use Jupyter Notebooks (local software) or Google Colaboratory (online platform).  \n",
    ">- Jupyter Notebooks: http://jupyter.org/install, and https://www.anaconda.com/download/ for the popular Anaconda distribution\n",
    ">- Google Colab is useful as an easy way to write interactive Python without having to install anything on your machine. Watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI\">Introduction to Colab</a> for more details. \n",
    "  - Text editors: Atom, Sublime\n",
    "  - PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\n",
    "\n",
    "While most of what we will do in class can be done in Colab, there may be advanced use cases where it useful to have one of these other options installed on your machine. So while we don't want you getting bogged down in installations right off the bat, it's a good idea to keep these in mind (we will go over Jupyter installation shortly).\n",

    "- Python: https://developers.google.com/edu/python/\n",
    "- Jupyter: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that the Google tutorial uses python2, so some of their example code may not directly work in python3:\n",
    "- Print statements now require parentheses: `print x` now becomes `print(x)`\n",
    "- No longer need to specify file encoding: `open('file.txt', 'r')` works\n",
    "- The division operator `/` no longer does integer divison: `5 / 2` is `2.5`\n",
    "- The `xrange` operator is now only `range`\n",
