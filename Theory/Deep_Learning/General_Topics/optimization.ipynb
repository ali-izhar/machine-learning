    "# Weight Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Small Random Numbers\n",
    "- Formula: $W = np.random.randn(shape) * 0.01$\n",
    "- Suitable for smaller networks. In deeper networks (e.g. 10 layers), activations and gradients will exponentially shrink or grow to zero or infinity. This is called the **vanishing/exploding gradient problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Xavier Initialization\n",
    "- Formula: $W = np.random.randn(shape) * \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{prev}}}$, where $n_{prev}$ is the number of neurons in the previous layer.\n",
    "- Best for tanh activation function.\n",
    "- Inefficient for ReLU activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## He Initialization\n",
    "- Formula: $W = np.random.randn(shape) * \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n_{prev}}}$, where $n_{prev}$ is the number of neurons in the previous layer.\n",
    "- Best for ReLU activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Batch Normalization\n",
    "- Purpose: Normalize the inputs to each layer, so that the inputs to the activation function are not too large/small. It maintains a consistent distribution of inputs to each layer.\n",
    "- Formula: $Z_{norm}^{(i)} = \\frac{Z^{(i)} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\epsilon}}$, where $\\mu$ is the mean of the inputs to the layer, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the inputs to the layer, and $\\epsilon$ is a small number to avoid division by zero.\n",
    "- Placement: After FC (fully connected) or CONV (convolutional) layers, but before the activation function.\n",
    "- Note: For non-standard activations, like tanh, which might not want a unit gaussian input:\n",
    "    - Updated formula: $Z_{norm}^{(i)} = \\gamma \\frac{Z^{(i)} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\epsilon}} + \\beta$, where $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ are learnable parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Batch Normalization Algorithm\n",
    "- Given: A mini-batch of $m$ examples.\n",
    "- Calculate: $\\mu = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} Z^{(i)}$ and $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (Z^{(i)} - \\mu)^2$.\n",
    "- Normalize: $Z_{norm}^{(i)} = \\frac{Z^{(i)} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\epsilon}}$.\n",
    "- Scale and shift: $Z_{norm}^{(i)} = \\gamma Z_{norm}^{(i)} + \\beta$, where $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ are learnable parameters of the model.\n",
    "- Output: $Z^{(i)} = Z_{norm}^{(i)}$.\n",

    "# Learning Rate Update Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Descent Update\n",
    "- Intuition: Imagine walking down a hill, taking small steps proportional to the steepness of the slope. If the slope is flat, steps are tiny; if the slope is steep, steps are large.\n",
    "- Challenge: Can be very slow, especially if the loss function has plateaus or shallow regions.\n",
    "- Formula: $w = w - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$, where $\\alpha$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Momentum Update\n",
    "- Intuition: Picture a ball rolling down a hill. The ball builds up momentum as it goes, helping it get over small bumps and converge faster.\n",
    "- Formula: $v = \\mu v - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$, where $\\mu$ is the momentum parameter and $v$ is the velocity vector. Then, $w = w + v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nesterov Momentum Update\n",
    "- Intuition: Before updating the position (like in Momentum), take a look ahead to see where our current momentum is taking us and then make a correction.\n",
    "- Formula: $v = \\mu v - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$, where $\\mu$ is the momentum parameter and $v$ is the velocity vector. Then, $w = w + \\mu v - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AdaGrad Update\n",
    "- Intuition: Adjusts the learning rate based on the history of the gradient. If we've seen a large gradient in the past, we'll be cautious and use a smaller learning rate. If we've seen small gradients in the past, we'll take bigger steps.\n",
    "- Formula: $w = w - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{G + \\epsilon}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$, where $G$ is the sum of the squares of the past gradients and $\\epsilon$ is a small number to avoid division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RMSProp Update\n",
    "- Intuition: Similar to AdaGrad, but instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, it maintains a moving average. This helps in not slowing down the learning too much.\n",
    "- Formula: $G = \\gamma G + (1 - \\gamma) \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} \\odot \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$, where $G$ is the moving average of the squared gradients and $\\gamma$ is the decay rate. Then, $w = w - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{G + \\epsilon}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adam Update\n",
    "- Intuition: Combines the ideas of Momentum and RMSProp. It calculates an exponential moving average of the gradient and the squared gradient, and the parameters beta1 and beta2 control the decay rates of these moving averages.\n",
    "- Formula: $m = \\beta_1 m + (1 - \\beta_1) \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$, where $m$ is the moving average of the gradient. Then, $v = \\beta_2 v + (1 - \\beta_2) \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} \\odot \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$, where $v$ is the moving average of the squared gradient. Then, $w = w - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{v + \\epsilon}} m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second Order Optimization Methods\n",
    "Given the loss function $L(w)$, we want to find the parameters $w$ that minimize $L(w)$. We can do this by taking the derivative of $L(w)$ with respect to $w$ and setting it to zero. This gives us the optimal parameters $w^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Newton-Hessian Parameter Update\n",
    "- Intuition: The Newton-Hessian method is a second-order optimization method that uses the second derivative of the loss function to update the parameters. It is very fast, but requires calculating the second derivative, which can be expensive.\n",
    "- Formula: $w = w - H^{-1} \\nabla_w L(w)$, where $H$ is the Hessian matrix of second derivatives.\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    - Fast convergence compared to first-order methods.\n",
    "    - Does not rely on hyperparameters like learning rate.\n",
    "- Challenges:\n",
    "    - Impractical for deep neural networks due to computational challenges. For instance, if there are one million parameters, the Hessian matrix becomes \\(10^6 \\times 10^6\\), making its inversion computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quasi-Newton Methods\n",
    "- Intuition: Quasi-Newton methods approximate the Hessian matrix, making it easier to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) Update\n",
    "- Intuition: Being the most popular, this method approximates the inverse Hessian using rank-1 updates over time, making it computationally more efficient than directly inverting the Hessian.\n",
    "- Formula: $w = w - H^{-1} \\nabla_w L(w)$, where $H$ is the Hessian matrix of second derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### L-BFGS (Limited Memory BFGS) Update\n",
    "- Intuition: This method is a memory-efficient version of BFGS, which approximates the inverse Hessian using rank-1 updates over time, making it computationally more efficient than directly inverting the Hessian.\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    - Avoids forming or storing the full inverse Hessian, hence the name \"limited memory\".\n",
    "    - Highly effective for full-batch, deterministic settings.\n",
    "- Challenges:\n",
    "    - Not suitable for mini-batch settings, where the loss function is stochastic.\n",
    "    - Not suitable for non-deterministic settings, where the loss function is non-deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization\n",
    "- Purpose: Prevent overfitting by reducing the model's capacity.\n",
    "- Formula: $L_{reg} = L + \\lambda \\Omega(w)$, where $L$ is the loss function, $\\lambda$ is the regularization strength, and $\\Omega(w)$ is the regularization term.\n",
    "- Note: Regularization is only applied during training, not during testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### L2 Regularization\n",
    "- Formula: $\\Omega(w) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2$, where $w_i$ is the $i$th parameter of the model.\n",
    "- Intuition: Penalizes large weights, making the model more robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### L1 Regularization\n",
    "- Formula: $\\Omega(w) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |w_i|$, where $w_i$ is the $i$th parameter of the model.\n",
    "- Intuition: Encourages sparsity, making the model more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout Regularization\n",
    "- Intuition: Randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much.\n",
    "- Formula: $L_{reg} = L + \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{1}_{\\{d_i = 0\\}} w_i^2$, where $d_i$ is the dropout mask for the $i$th unit, and $\\mathbb{1}_{\\{d_i = 0\\}}$ is the indicator function that returns 1 if $d_i = 0$ and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Augmentation\n",
    "- Intuition: Increase the size of the training set by applying transformations to the data, such as flipping, rotating, cropping, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Stopping\n",
    "- Intuition: Stop training when the validation loss starts to increase, as this is a sign of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "- Purpose: Find the best hyperparameters for the model.\n",
    "- Note: Hyperparameters are not learned during training, but are set before training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grid Search\n",

    "- Challenges:\n",
    "    - Computationally expensive.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Random Search\n",

    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    - Computationally efficient.\n",

    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    - Computationally efficient.\n",
    "    - Suitable for continuous hyperparameters.\n",
    "    - Can handle noisy loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Checking\n",
    "- Purpose: Check if the gradients are being calculated correctly.\n",
    "- Formula: $gradapprox = \\frac{J(\\theta + \\epsilon) - J(\\theta - \\epsilon)}{2 \\epsilon}$, where $J$ is the loss function, $\\theta$ is the parameters of the model, and $\\epsilon$ is a small number.\n",
    "- Note: Gradient checking is computationally expensive, so it should only be used to check the gradients, not to train the model.\n",
