# Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. It has applications in various areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

Deep learning models involve a large number of parameters and layers, which are trained on large datasets. These models can learn complex patterns and representations from data.
