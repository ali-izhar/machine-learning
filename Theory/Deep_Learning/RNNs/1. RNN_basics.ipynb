A form of sequence models are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which are often used to process speech data (e.g. speech recognition, machine translation), generative models (e.g. generating music) or NLP (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), etc.).\n",

To determine the influence of the activation and the input token, the two weight matrices $W_{aa}$ and $W_{ax}$ are used. There is also a matrix $W_{ya}$ that governs the output predictions. Those matrices are the same at each time step, i.e. they are shared for a single training instance. This way the layer is recursively used to process the sequence. A single input token can therefore not only directly influence the output at a given time step, but also indirectly the output of subsequent steps (thus the term recurrent). Vice versa - a single prediction at time step $t$ not only depends on a single input token at time step $t$, but on several previously seen tokens.\n",

    "There is not an universal rule when to use GRU- or LSTM-cells. GRU cells represent a simpler model, hence they are more suitable to build a bigger RNN model because they are computationally more efficient and the RNN will scale faster. On the other hand the LSTM-cells are more powerful and more flexible, but they also require more training data. As a rule-of-thumb, practitioners will often use LSTM cells as they're more powerful and have longer richer than GRU cells."

    "# 8 - Bidirectional RNN (BRNN)\n",

    "Unidirectional RNNs only consider already seen tokens at a time step $t$ to make a prediction. In contrast, bidirectional RNN (BRNN) also take subsequent tokens into account. This is helpful for NER when trying to predict whether the word \"Teddy\" is part of a name in the following two sencences:\n",

    "    \n",
    "Just by looking at the previously seen words it is not clear at time step $t=3$ whether $<teddy>$ is part of a name or not. To do that we need the information of the following tokens. \n",
    "    \n",
    "A BRNN can do this using an additional layer. During forward propagation the activation values $\\overrightarrow{a}$ are computed as seen above from the input tokens and the previous activation values using an RNN cell (normal RNN cell, GRU or LSTM). The second part of forward propagation calculates the values $\\overleftarrow{a}$ from left to right using the additional layer. The following picture illustrates this. Note that the arrows in blue and green only indicate the order in which the tokens are evaluated. It does not indicate backpropagation.\n",

    "The advantage of BRNN is that it allows to take into account words from both directions when making a prediction, which makes it a good fit for many language-related applications like machine translation. On the downside, because tokens from both directions are considered, the whole sequence needs to be processed before a prediction can be made. This makes it unsuitable for tasks like real-time speech recognition."
