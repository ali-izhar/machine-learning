# Anomaly Detection: An Overview
Anomaly detection is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns from an unlabeled dataset of normal events and detects unusual or anomalous events. This algorithm is used in various applications, such as fraud detection, manufacturing, and monitoring computer clusters.

## Example: Aircraft Engine Manufacturing

### Identifying Anomalies in Aircraft Engines
Imagine a scenario where an aircraft engine is being manufactured. The engine must be reliable and function well, as any failure can lead to catastrophic consequences. Anomaly detection can be used to check if a newly manufactured engine appears anomalous or if there seems to be anything wrong with it.

**Features of Aircraft Engine**
After an aircraft engine rolls off the assembly line, several features can be computed, such as:

- Feature x1: Heat generated by the engine
- Feature x2: Vibration intensity
- Additional features as required

**Data Collection**
Manufacturers typically produce a high percentage of good engines, so it is relatively easy to collect data on normal engines (features x1 and x2) rather than defective ones.

**Anomaly Detection Problem**
The goal is to learn from examples of how aircraft engines typically behave (in terms of heat and vibration) and identify if a new engine appears similar or if something seems unusual, warranting further inspection.

**Anomaly Detection Algorithm**
The algorithm works by plotting the examples in a graph and looking at the heat and vibration signature. If the new engine's values fall within the normal range, it's considered fine. If it falls outside the typical range, it might be flagged as an anomaly.

### Density Estimation Technique
A common approach to anomaly detection is density estimation. It involves building a model for the probability of x (feature values), identifying regions of higher or lower probability.

If the probability of a new test example (Xtest) is less than a small threshold (epsilon), it is flagged as an anomaly. If the probability is greater, it's considered normal.
