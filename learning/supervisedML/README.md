# Terminology

## Dataset
A dataset refers to the collection of data used to train and test a machine learning model. It is typically divided into two sections: the training set and the test set. Within the training set, the input variables are often referred to as `inputs` or `features`. A single input variable is represented by $x$, while a collection of input variables is symbolized by $X$.

The output variables in the training set are known as `targets`. A singular target is represented by $y$, and a collection of targets is symbolized by $Y$.

In this context, a single training example is expressed as $(x, y)$. A specific training example, referring to a particular row in the training set, is represented by $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$, where $i$ denotes the index of the training example. The total number of training examples in the set is denoted by $m$.
