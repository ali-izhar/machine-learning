## Educational Content
This section comprises of my attempts at implementing various Machine Learning algorithms and techniques. Drawing from a wide array of resources, I design each Python module to encapsulate the material learned. Every module is self-contained with a corresponding README that elucidates the underlying mathematical concepts and implementation strategies. For example, the [Naive Bayes classifier](/learning/naive_bayes_classifier/) module is used for spam detection. These modules are designed for reusability across different projects.

## Practical Projects
This section features mini-projects where I apply the concepts and techniques learned. These projects, which include my solo efforts and collaborations, make extensive use of the modules implemented in the Educational Content section. Emulating real-world scenarios, these projects leverage actual datasets to solve problems.

## Learning Resources
My journey into Machine Learning is guided by an assortment of resources. These include online courses, books, and tutorials. Currently, my main sources of knowledge are:
* [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?)
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization by DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science?)
* [Introduction to Deep Learning by MIT](http://introtodeeplearning.com)

## Motivation
As an avid learner of computer science and mathematics, the intriguing cross-section of programming and predictive modeling has captivated my attention. This fascination for understanding how machines interpret data to make decisions has led me to embark on this Machine Learning journey. I am eager to unravel these concepts and apply them to solve real-world problems, thereby building upon my solid foundation in programming and mathematical thinking.

# Machine Learning Theory and Practice
This repository contains various machine learning algorithms and their implementations in Python using the Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Tensorflow libraries. The algorithms are organized by category and are grouped into folders based on their category. Please note that this repository is a work in progress and is constantly being updated.

## Motivation

- **ANI vs AGI:** ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) is the concept of an AI system that can perform one task very well, such as self-driving cars or smart speakers. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is the concept of an AI system that can perform any task a human can. There has been a lot of progress in ANI, but AGI is still a long way off. The goal of this repository is to explore the various algorithms that are used to build ANI systems.

- **Neural Networks and Brain Simulation:** Although modern deep learning has seen advancements in simulating neurons, there are limitations. The artificial neurons we build are overly simplistic compared to their biological counterparts, and our understanding of how the human brain works is still rudimentary. The path to AGI through brain simulation appears to be quite challenging.

- **One Learning Algorithm Hypothesis:** Based on certain animal experiments, it is suggested that much of intelligence might be due to one or a few learning algorithms - the concept of `one learning algorithm hypothesis`. Depending on the input data, different parts of the brain can learn to perform various tasks. The challenge lies in discovering these algorithms and implementing them in a computer.

- **Flexibility of the Brain:** Experiments show that the human brain is highly adaptable, capable of processing a wide range of sensor inputs. Researchers are studying these mechanisms to understand if they can be replicated in AI systems.
