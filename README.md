# Exploring the Art of Predictive Modeling: My Journey Through Machine Learning
This is a repository to document my journey in learning Machine Learning. I will update this repository as I learn new concepts, techniques, and tools in Machine Learning.

## Table of Contents
* [code](#Code)
* [learning](#Learning)
* [projects](#Projects)

## Code
This folder contains code related to the topics that I am learning. The code is written in Python - mostly through Jupyter Notebooks for ease of use and readability.

## Learning
This folder contains implementations of Machine Learning algorithms and techniques that I am learning from the resources mentioned below.

## Projects
This folder contains mini projects that I am working on to apply the concepts and techniques that I am learning. The projects are based on real-world problems and datasets.

## Learning Resources
To learn Machine Learning, I will be using a variety of resources including online courses, books, and tutorials. Some of the resources that I am currently using are:
* [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?)
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization by DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science?)
* [Introduction to Deep Learning by MIT](http://introtodeeplearning.com)

## Motivation
As a student of computer science and mathematics, I have always been drawn to programming and the exciting possibilities that arise from predictive modeling. My passion for understanding how machines can learn from data to make decisions and predictions has led me to embark on a journey into the world of Machine Learning. I am eager to explore the concepts and apply them to real-world problems, building on my foundation in programming and mathematical thinking.
