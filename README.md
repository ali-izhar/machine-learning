# My Machine Learning Journey
This is a repository to document my journey in learning Machine Learning. I will update this repository as I learn new concepts, techniques, and tools in Machine Learning.

## Motivation
----------------
As a student of computer science and mathematics, I have always been drawn to programming and the exciting possibilities that arise from predictive modeling. My passion for understanding how machines can learn from data to make decisions and predictions has led me to embark on a journey into the world of Machine Learning. I am eager to explore the concepts and apply them to real-world problems, building on my foundation in programming and mathematical thinking.

## Learning Resources
---------------------
To learn Machine Learning, I will be using a variety of resources including online courses, books, and tutorials. Some of the resources that I will be using are:

* [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?)
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization by DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science?)
* [Microsoft's Machine Learning Course](https://github.com/ali-izhar/ML-For-Beginners)

## Repository Structure
-----------------------
This repository will be structured in the following way:
* Each topic or project will have its own folder
* Inside each folder, there will be a README file that explains the concept, technique, or project
* Any code or data related to the topic or project will be included in the respective folder
