## Educational Content
This section comprises of my attempts at implementing various Machine Learning algorithms and techniques. Drawing from a wide array of resources, I design each Python module to encapsulate the material learned. Every module is self-contained with a corresponding README that elucidates the underlying mathematical concepts and implementation strategies. For example, the [Naive Bayes classifier](/learning/naive_bayes_classifier/) module is used for spam detection. These modules are designed for reusability across different projects.

## Practical Projects
This section features mini-projects where I apply the concepts and techniques learned. These projects, which include my solo efforts and collaborations, make extensive use of the modules implemented in the Educational Content section. Emulating real-world scenarios, these projects leverage actual datasets to solve problems.

## Learning Resources
My journey into Machine Learning is guided by an assortment of resources. These include online courses, books, and tutorials. Currently, my main sources of knowledge are:
* [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?)
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization by DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science?)
* [Introduction to Deep Learning by MIT](http://introtodeeplearning.com)

## Motivation
As an avid learner of computer science and mathematics, the intriguing cross-section of programming and predictive modeling has captivated my attention. This fascination for understanding how machines interpret data to make decisions has led me to embark on this Machine Learning journey. I am eager to unravel these concepts and apply them to solve real-world problems, thereby building upon my solid foundation in programming and mathematical thinking.
